# Goal
India is a country of 1.4 billion people, nine major religions, 22 official languages, 19500 unofficial languages/dialects, and has a vibrant history affecting its laws today. To deal with this, India maintains a hybrid legal system with a mixture of civil, common law and customary, Islamic ethics, or religious law within the legal framework inherited from the colonial era and various other legislations first introduced by the British colonial masters. Indian laws also adhere to the United Nations guidelines on various issues, including human rights law and environmental law. Since the drafting of the Indian Constitution more than 70 years back, it has become the lengthiest constitution anywhere in the world.

While natural language processing has progressed a lot, it still lacks much in the legal domain, especially in the Indian legal domain. With the most extensive constitution and a myriad system of laws, the Indian legal domain offers both a unique opportunity and a challenge to build unique NLP solutions for it.

Moreover, with people becoming more and more aware, the number of cases is rising. Last year, the Supreme Court of India alone had more than 80,000 cases. The rise in cases also leads to a consequent increase in the pendency of cases.  More than 40 million cases were pending before all the courts till this year. All of this calls for efficient NLP solutions for the Indian legal domain. Project Vidhaan aims to do that. The goal of this project is to build a high-quality corpus of Indian laws. This corpus will be used to better the natural language understanding of Indian laws.
